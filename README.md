# todolist README

todolist is a simple VS Code extension that mimics the author's current todo list stylings used in Notepad++, that are a mishmash of Bullet Journal and GTD esque things.

## Syntax

- Todo list items are marked with an @ or a - at the start of a line.
  - @ is usually a main todo item, and - is a sub-bullet, sometimes even just an actionable note.
- Notes are marked with // to start a comment
- High priority items are flagged with !!! anywhere in the line

## Features

* Marking items as done via the Command Palette, which turns them a lighter grey.
* Uhhh more features to come, like undoing the Done, keyboard shortcuts, color highlighting, etc.


## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.
